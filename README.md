# Dependensies
# es_extended

# This is similar to what esx_handcuffs does. Just diffrent ways of getting loose and animation. 

# Installation is simple

1. You should prob edit the sql since you might want to add it to a diffrent shop like blackmarket maybe. Cableties are not limited to police but i would suggest limiting them to blackmarket and police.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Like handcuffs you need a key to unlock. Here you need a certain knife.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Also if you are using esx_inventoryhud you will have to add the pngs for the items there also to see them in the inventory. Pngs are added to the repository.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Also should mention that it can be cuppled together with esx_policejob. But then a number of lines needs to be added to that resource. For now its disabled inside client.lua
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. If you have done all the above it just the normal routine left "start esx_cableties"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of now it share the same animation as handcuffs. Might add something uniqe to it later on.
