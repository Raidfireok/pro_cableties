# Dependensies
# es_extended

# This is similar to what esx_handcuffs does. Just diffrent ways of getting loose and animation. 

# Installation is simple

1. You should prob edit the sql since you might want to add it to a diffrent shop like blackmarket maybe. Cableties are not limited to police but i would suggest limiting them to blackmarket and police.
2. Like handcuffs you need a key to unlock. Here you need a certain knife.

3. Also if you are using esx_inventoryhud you will have to add the pngs for the items there also to see them in the inventory. Pngs are added to the repository.

4. Also should mention that it can be cuppled together with esx_policejob. But then a number of lines needs to be added to that resource. For now its disabled inside client.lua

5. If you have done all the above it just the normal routine left "start esx_cableties"

Just to mention these are not part of the ESX family but names it the same to make it easier.

As of now it share the same animation as handcuffs. Might add something uniqe to it later on.
