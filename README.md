# Introduction
This is similar to what esx_handcuffs does. Just diffrent ways of getting loose and animation(hopefully if i can find the correct one) So the code itself on the animationside could be improved. This is meant for civillians but can also be used police. The items added threw the use of the SQL included is knife and cableties. The knife is used to unlock/cut the cableties. 

# Getting Started

# Installation

1. There is an SQL in the folder that adds the items to be used(cableties and knife) and also inserts into DB:`shops`
   But the SQL is just a basic setup so more "shops" should be added to it(EDIT)

2. PNGS should be added to html/img of esx_shops. And same if your are using esx_inventoryhud
   Remeber to add them in each __resource.lua to show inventory and shop images.

3. Whats left is adding "start pro_cableties" to your server.cfg

4. # Dependencies: essentialmode, es_extended

5. This is the first release of this so the code could be improved upon.


# Testrun of code:

1. I have successfully cabletied someone with this. But at the moment the knife would not work. I have made some
   minor changes after that so they might work now. Have not tested after latest tweak. 



# Based on esx_handcuffs 

Feel free to change the code. The thing with this code is that you can multiply it into
anything. You could
